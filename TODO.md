### TODO Items for Hugo site

1. Integrate theme into a submodule
> https://github.com/mgjohansen/hucore.git

2. Get Google Analytics working on G Suite
> #googleAnalytics = "trackingcode"

3. Create `www` repo to replace `thehar.com` on Github

4. Archive `thehar.com` entries from prior website.

5. Create a Makefile or Rakefile to automate more.

6. Change Favicon to something more branded. Also include some #003366 color into the icons.

7. Add 404 and 500 pages to theme since they seem to be missing and are boring.

8. Lets test Codeship free on this repo as well since we are using it at Upwork.
