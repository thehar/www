&lt;p&gt;So, I am currently reading &lt;code&gt;Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap&lt;/code&gt;, by Jim Collins. Upwork&amp;rsquo;s SVP of Engineering suggested this book to engineering staff and it&amp;rsquo;s been a very interesting read during my trip.  In just a short time, I&amp;rsquo;ve grown to really admire him as a very valuable and intelligent person.  Flying back home currently and I notice there are some pretty great communications to motivate through struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without struggle we can&amp;rsquo;t learn. With struggle comes growth. Life is about learning and living your truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;We are working too hard. Do not panic.
Our darkest moments provide a fantastic time for us to learn
because whatever we do from here can&#39;t make matters worse but
it might make it better.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work smarter, not harder.  This is how successful and happy people live.  I learned this very valuable lesson on this trip to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-books-recommended&#34;&gt;Other books recommended:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficult Conversations - Douglas Stone&lt;br /&gt;
Emotional Intelligence - Daniel Goleman&lt;br /&gt;
Working with Emotional Intelligence - Daniel Goleman&lt;br /&gt;
Destructive Emotions: How Can We Overcome Them? A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama - Daniel Goleman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to sharing more of my incredible journey these past two weeks and continued career learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
