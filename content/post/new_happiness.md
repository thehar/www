So, I am currently reading `Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap`, by Jim Collins. Upwork's SVP of Engineering suggested this book to engineering staff and it's been a very interesting read during my trip.  In just a short time, I've grown to really admire him as a very valuable and intelligent person.  Flying back home currently and I notice there are some pretty great communications to motivate through struggle.

Without struggle we can't learn. With struggle comes growth. Life is about learning and living your truth.

```
We are working too hard. Do not panic.
Our darkest moments provide a fantastic time for us to learn
because whatever we do from here can't make matters worse but
it might make it better.
```

Work smarter, not harder.  This is how successful and happy people live.  I learned this very valuable lesson on this trip to Europe.

## Other books recommended:
Difficult Conversations - Douglas Stone  
Emotional Intelligence - Daniel Goleman  
Working with Emotional Intelligence - Daniel Goleman  
Destructive Emotions: How Can We Overcome Them? A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama - Daniel Goleman

I look forward to sharing more of my incredible journey these past two weeks and continued career learning.
