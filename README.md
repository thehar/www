# thehar.com source code

This is the respository for thehar.com.  It is generated statically by [hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com) with the [hucore](https://github.com/mgjohansen/hucore) theme. The web site is served up by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and backed by the S3 asset store web site hosting.  In order to keep costs low, Cloudflare serves up front-end DNS and SSL termination.  This allows for easier maintenance and a much lower security attack vector, as I am not the one managing the infrastructure.
